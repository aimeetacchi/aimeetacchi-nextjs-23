                <p className="text-base">As a self-taught developer with almost 7 years of experience, I am constantly driven to learn and expand my knowledge. I am passionate about coding and spend much of my free time exploring new technologies and building projects. Even when I&#39;m not coding for work, I&#39;m always looking for ways to challenge myself and improve my skills. With each new project, I strive to push the boundaries of what I can accomplish and continue to grow as a developer.</p>
